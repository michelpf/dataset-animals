# Animal Recognition

This dataset was originally downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biancaferreira/african-wildlife).

The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of Python classes with organized data.

This data set contains at least 376 images for each animal class collected via Google's image search function and labelled for object detection. Each example in the data set consists of a jpg image and a txt label file. The images have differing aspect ratios and contain at least one example of the specified animal class. Multiple instances of animals can exist in a single image. There could also be occurrences of the other classes in the same image, e.g. a zebra(3) in the file with an elephant(1).

The txt file contains a list of detectable instances on separate lines of the class in the YOLOv3 labeling format. 

This dataset was adapted for use in Machine Learning classes.
